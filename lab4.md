### Step 1: Delete existing forks of repository on account

I first used the `rm -rf path-to-directory` command to delete my existing fork of the repository and all its contents from my Github account.

<br/>

### Step 2: Fork the repository

I visited this [link](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7) to the Lab 7 repository and forked it again.

<br/>

### Step 3: Start the timer

I got the timer ready and pressed "Start" as I began to do Steps 4 to 9.

<br/>

### Step 4: Log into ieng6

First, I logged into ieng6 with `ssh cs15lsp23ip@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. Because we previously generated an SSH key for ieng6, I did not have to enter the password.

<br/>

### Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

### Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

First, I changed my directory to go into the lab7 directory, then compiled and ran the code using respective `javac` and `java` commands. I did this by typing `h` in my terminal to access my command history, then found these commands on lines 209 and 210 in my history. I then did the following:

### Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test
